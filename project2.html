<h2>Post-Grad Plans</h2>
<p> I firstly plan on taking an extra semester at Notre Dame so I will able to have the time to complete an honors degree. In the Spring of 2015 I will hopefully be spending time in <strong>Panama</strong> teaching children English while solidifying my own Spanish through World Teach.
</p>

<p>
After World Teach I will be taking the LSAT and applying for Law School. I will <em>hopefully</em> get into my school of choice and then will be spending my time learning to become a lawyer like both of my parents. I'm not sure where I will end up after Law School but hopefully in a place with <strong>great</strong> weather.
